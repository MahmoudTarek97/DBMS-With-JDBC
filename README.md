# DBMS-With-JDBC

This is a database management system (DBMS) that allows the user to easily save data in tables
and manipulate it using SQL.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) provides Java developers with a standard API
that is used to access databases, regardless of the driver and database product.

This DBMS is integrated with JDBC by implementing JDBC standard interfaces.
